## Getting Started Notes

- You're not given any HTML markup inside of the `<body></body>` tags, first start by outlining the main elements. Once you have done that, you can start implementing the styles. You'll be expected to edit `style.css` to implement the styles. 

- The `style.css` and `index.html` files are linked, which you can see in the `<head></head>` tag 

- Note about the layout: focus primarily on using your knowledge of CSS Grid and Flexbox to implement the layout in a logical way.

- Implement and assign proper sizes for the assets. The page should be responsive, hence use media queries for different sizes.

- Assets and information about fonts and color schemes are provided. However, feel free to use your own.

## Design notes

We want to make sure that our site has a consistent look and feel, so we'll use the following style choices:

### Font

2 fonts are used in this project: `Montserrat` and  `Sacramento`. You can find these fonts on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Color schemes

Primary: `#F7B180` and `#18471B`
Secondary: `#FFFFFF` and `#000000`

## Submission Method

1. One person should create an empty repository on Github and share it with their partner. Each of you should clone it to your local environment.

2. Follow the instructions above to create the landing page.

3. Share your repository with your instructor once it is completed.
